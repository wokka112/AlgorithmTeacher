# Algorithm Teacher

Algorithm teacher is a C# .NET console application designed to help people learn how different algorithms work. Algorithms for anything from multiplication through to
sorting may one day be available on it. It is, more than anything, a personal project to help the developer get a better grasp of different algorithms.
